# SchoolMacros 

Some scripts to make my school work easier.

## Installation 

1. Install AutoHotkey V1
  https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Clone the project
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/roopekt/SchoolMacros.git
  ```
3. Make one of the scripts start on computer startup

    I've used the Windows startup folder at
    `C:\Users\<USER-NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.
    Any programs here will be ran on Windows startup, lnk files work too.
    `GF63_SchoolKeyboard.ahk` and `LenovoKeyboard.ahk` are my entry points.
